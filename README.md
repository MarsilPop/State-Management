State Management and State Design Pattern lecture 
Project done during frankslaboratory's 10h JavaScript Game Development Course.

In this Lecture, I've learned how to implement STATE DESIGN PATTERN in a side-scroller game, how to use native JAVASCRIPT MODULES to split our code into multiple parts, and other important game development tricks and techniques.
2D art for the course was provided by https://bevouliin.com/.
